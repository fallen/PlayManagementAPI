This is an implementation of Play Management API based on JGroups


General Use  :

Play Management System :
the play management system is meant to be instantiated on each node. There should
be two implementations of this interface if client and server nodes are distinguished.


RevokableToken :
the API is based on the fact that revocableTokens should be kept private by
their owners. if a player want to identify himself by an admin then he should transmit its
accountUId. RevokableToken should not be transmitted between nodes, but only accountUId.

NB : the xxxUId have a method "isEqualTo" instead of overriding "equals" because
this latter solution would force fulfill the "equals contract" -> updating 
hashcode() etc
